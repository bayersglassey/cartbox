What is a minimal test for generating a correct statistic?
    * start with no orders
    * place order with banana and apple
    * place order with just banana
    * generates what samples?..
    * stats should show:
        * if you order apple, you have 100% chance of ordering banana
        * if you order banana, you have 50% chance of ordering apple

TODO:

    * Actually make suggestions.

    * Instead of 'suggested' BooleanField, have a 'tags' CharField
        which is a set of strings encoded as a comma-separated list.

    * If we want to completely separate 'analysis' and 'cart' apps,
        we should have analysis.models Product and Category, which
        just store sku/id/title for display purposes.
        I mean basically... the 'cart' app is doing that already
        for theoretical "big e-commerce systems" which might use
        CartBox via an API or whatever...

    * Rename ItemPlacedSample, ItemsPlacedTogetherSample
        -> SKUInOrderCounter, SKUPairInOrderCounter
            These objects are *counting* things - they are not samples.
            Also, these objects are counting *predicates*, not items.


ISSUES:

    * Is there a Django field which will render as <select multiple>?..
        'Cos otherwise we're gonna have to figure out how to pass POSTed
        skus and suggested_skus to the template so it can render
        <option selected>s all over the place. You know?

    * Getting statistics for categories isn't actually possible with
        current setup.
        See Order.generate_items_placed_samples.
        We would need a different type of sample which tracked sku
        against category, and another type for category against
        category.
        ...but I don't yet completely understand what
        ItemsPlacedTogetherSample.cat1/cat2 are tracking...
        -> SKUInOrderCounter, SKUPairInOrderCounter

    * Since there's no thing as a cart, there's no way to make
        suggestions in the way we were planning!..
        Ok, so add a button to "shop" page which says "update cart"
        or whatever. Really it just refreshes suggested products.
