What is a minimal test for generating a correct statistic?
    * start with no orders
    * place order with banana and apple
    * place order with just banana
    * generates what samples?..
    * stats should show:
        * if you order apple, you have 100% chance of ordering banana
        * if you order banana, you have 50% chance of ordering apple

TODO:

    * Instead of 'suggested' BooleanField, have a 'tags' CharField
        which is a set of strings encoded as a comma-separated list.
    * If we want to completely separate 'analysis' and 'cart' apps,
        we should have analysis.models Product and Category, which
        just store sku/id/title for display purposes.
        I mean basically... the 'cart' app is doing that already
        for theoretical "big e-commerce systems" which might use
        CartBox via an API or whatever...
