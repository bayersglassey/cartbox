We spent some time trying to make sure sku1 < sku2 for all 2-item samples.
But it frigs things up somewhat, e.g. trying to implement the stats page.
What if we just generate "reversed" versions of all 2-item samples?..
So if you add banana and apple to your cart & place an order,
you get a sample for (banana, apple) and another for (apple, banana).
Do we allow (banana, banana)?.. does not allowing it mess up the stats?..

What is a minimal test for generating a correct statistic?
    * start with no orders
    * place order with banana and apple
    * place order with just banana
    * generates what samples?..
    * stats should show:
        * if you order apple, you have 100% chance of ordering banana
        * if you order banana, you have 50% chance of ordering apple
