    <h2>Analytics: Sample Search</h2>
    <p>
        "Samples" are generated when certain events occur,
        like a particular product being placed as an order item,
        or a particular pair of products being placed together
        as items in the same order.
    </p>
    <p>
        This page allows you to search raw sample data,
        but probably what you really want to see are some
        <a href="/analytics/stats/">statistics</a>.
